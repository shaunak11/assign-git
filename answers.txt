What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

gitingore file is information for 'git' in form of list of extentions. It is used while
one tries to push the code, 'git' ignores files ending with mentioned extentions. This
helps prevent upload of unnecessary files that are not required for source control. 
Files like '.project' for eclipse, package files with '.jar', '.war', '.rar' etc; log
file with '.log'. These files may vary for each developer and are not needed for 
control of the source code. 


What does fast-forward in Git mean?

When user does merge branch on 'git', fast forward is when that branch is ahead of
checked out branch.


Why should you have different branches?

Having different branches helps different users/ to work on respective development
and not worry about other programmers messing with it. If a software is such that it
requires different environments or different features, with the help of branches,
one can easily have separate working space. And it merely is a copied pointer, so
main stream of work base is same.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

There usually is only one repository. May vary depending on project.
